# Contributing

Caching is hard. Chances are that if some feature was left out, it was left out on purpose because it didn't make sense to cache in that way. This is used in production at Shopify so we are very opinionated about the types of features we're going to add. Please start the discussion early, before even adding code, so that we can talk about the feature you are proposing and decide if it makes sense in IdentityCache.

Types of contributions we welcome:

- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- Documentation and/or clearer interfaces


### How To Contribute

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

Please keep the following in mind:

- Add a short entry to the "unreleased" section in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) describing your changes.
- Do not change `IdentityCache::VERSION`; this is done as part of the release process.
